Good afternoon,
 
We're pleased to announce that we have successfully built a replacement for the /public file system which was previously exported via the website userweb.molbiol.ox.ac.uk. We recommend that you read this e-mail carefully.
 
The new service is called datashare and has two components.
 
The file system /datashare
This can be written to and read on the login nodes and read (but not written to) on any of the cluster nodes
It is not part of /t1-data
Every active user account has a directory at /datashare/user_name
Every collaboration project additionally has a directory at /datashare/project/project_name that any member of the project can write to
There is a 100G quota per user account
If you find that you need additional space please contact us via genmail@molbiol.ox.ac.uk so that we can consider your request
please note that it is not possible to allocate quota to projects
To make data publicly available via the web server, simply copy the data into the /datashare area
Please note that you cannot use symlinks to point to /t1-data
The website is datashare.molbiol.ox.ac.uk
Your user data will appear at datashare.molbiol.ox.ac.uk/public/user_name/
Project data will appear at datashare.molbiol.ox.ac.uk/public/project/project_name/
It is not possible to customise web server configuration using htaccess files
If you have a need of advanced features please contact us via genmail@molbiol.ox.ac.uk
 
For backwards compatibility purposes, the web address userweb.molbiol.ox.ac.uk will be redirected to point to the new service next week. To ensure that your old links continue to work, please copy the necessary files into their equivalent locations in /datashare. For example, a file currently at /public/auser/myBigWig.bw should be copied to /datashare/auser/myBigWig.bw
 
If you have any questions or problems please contact us via genmail@molbiol.ox.ac.uk
 
Yours,
 
The CCB Team
